You’ve been given a research assignment on &#39;&#39;technological developments&#39;&#39; and don&#39;t know where to start. Sometimes the hardest part comes right at the beginning, when you need to determine what to research. 

How do you [[start]]? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="start" tags="" position="500,475" size="100,100">A good place to start is by reading the assignment requirements //carefully//. Even a well written, interesting paper will not succeed if it does not fulfill the requirements. You&#39;ll also will save yourself &#39;&#39;a lot of work&#39;&#39; if you clearly understand the requirements before you start your research.

&lt;/div&gt;

Some assignments require you to find peer-review articles or conduct surveys or experiments, while others ask you to stick with sources you’ve already been assigned for class reading.

What are the appropriate step in [[developing]] a focus on your paper?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="developing" tags="" position="525,625" size="100,100">
What is the best course of action?  

* Start identfying technological developments that [[you didn&#39;t cover]] in class.

* [[Review]] your syllabus and class notes to select a technological development that interests you.

* Decide to conduct research on [[Steve Jobs]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Review" tags="" position="600,900" size="100,100">//That&#39;s right!// 

Since the assignment states that you should select a&#39;&#39; technological development&#39;&#39; that you have studied in class, reviewing your class materials to choose one is an good  early step. [[Explore]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Explore" tags="" position="900,325" size="100,100">If you understand your assignment’s requirements while keeping an open mind when developing your research focus, you’re well &#39;&#39;(text-colour:purple)[on your way to success!]&#39;&#39;

But where do you go now? You have a basic idea about what you want to explore, but there are a few other ways you can (text-colour:purple)[&#39;&#39;“pre-research”&#39;&#39;] to sharpen your topic.

//Look at//

[[Reference databases]]

[[Title of articles, magazines or book chapters ]]

[[Explore topics in news sources]]


You may use //one or two of these strategies, or a combination//. Most importantly, have a toolkit of options to choose from depending on what will work best for your particular assignment.

[[search terms]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Title of articles, magazines or book chapters " tags="" position="925,875" size="100,100">Scan the titles of magazine articles or book chapters. //You don&#39;t want to read the articles or the book chapters at this stage// that would take&#39;&#39; too&#39;&#39; much time! What you can do is just scan the titles that it will give you ideas onthe current resaerch trends.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Explore topics in news sources" tags="" position="1075,675" size="100,100">For current event topics, you can narrow to one aspect that interests you.

One of the best things about pre-research is that it not only helps you determine what you’re interested in researching, it also gives you ideas for search terms that will allow you to further refine your focus.

As you run initial searches keep in mind your assignment requirements. Keep a list of terms or names related to your topic.

Topic:
Technological developments

Your list of initial keywords might look like this:

* technological developments
* technology
* artificial intelligence
* computer science
* innovation
  
  [[Refine]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Refine" tags="" position="1450,375" size="100,100">Refining your research focus. Do some preliminary investigative work to see if there&#39;s too much (or too little) information on the topic you&#39;ve selected.

After running a few searches what are you seeing?

&lt;/style&gt;&lt;img src= https://foreignpolicyi.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/students.jpg


&lt;/div&gt;

Are the results:

[[Too narrow?]]

[[Too broad?]]

[[Manageable?]]


[[Strategy]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Strategy" tags="" position="1700,325" size="100,100">Revisit the earlier list of [[search terms]] for technological developments.

After further exploration your list might include these terms:
 
* artificial intelligence
* AI 
* intelligent machine
* chatbots

* Has your reseearch focus changed? 

* Has the topic become more specific?

* How has your list of search terms changed?

I hope the answer is (text-colour:purple)+(bg:black)[&#39;&#39;YES&#39;&#39;]

It’s the sign of an engaged researcher if your research focus evolves as you learn more. 

At the beginning of the process, you only may know enough to have a general idea of what you want to write about, but as you explore multiple sources and hit on something more specific that you can study more deeply.
